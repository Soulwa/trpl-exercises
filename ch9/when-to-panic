panic when:
- prototyping code (unwrap)
- examples
- testing (should fail)

can use unwrap when:
- more info than the compiler
	- ex: "127.0.0.1".parse().unwrap()

panic:
- code is in a bad state
	- shouldn't continue in this state
	- not expected to happen
	- code relies on being in good state
	- no good way to encode failure
- expected failure : Result type! (ie HTTP request)

can add custom types for data validation
